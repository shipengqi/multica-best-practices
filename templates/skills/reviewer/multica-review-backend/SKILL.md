# Backend Implementation Professional Review (BackendReviewer)

Structured professional review framework for **backend implementation artifacts (API contract + implementation)**. Called by `BackendReviewer`; reviews the links `BackendDev` returns via `multica-artifact-backend` and code-class skill (Apifox / changed-file list), plus the architecture design ref Leader passes.

## When to use
- BackendReviewer receives a "review backend implementation" dispatch from Leader.
- Entering a re-review round after implementation changes (check previous round's fix list item by item).

## Review dimensions (conclusion per item)
1. **Contract quality**: field naming, status codes, error model, versioning clear & self-consistent.
2. **Design fit**: implementation aligned with Architect plan, deviations explained.
3. **Error handling**: exception branches, timeouts, idempotency, boundaries covered.
4. **Unit-test sufficiency**: key paths, boundaries, exception branches covered; no invalid or low-value tests (mark & block).
5. **Acceptance mapping**: implementation truly satisfies every AC-.

## Output format
```
【Backend Review】<change link>
Conclusion: PASS / FAIL
Blocking items (required on FAIL, each: rationale / involved point / fix direction):
- ...
Suggestions (non-blocking):
- ...
Previous fix-list check (re-review): resolved X / unresolved Y
Round: N / 3
```
Conclusion + fix list **reported to Leader**; don't modify code or notify BackendDev yourself.

## Boundaries
- Review only backend contract & implementation, unit tests; not frontend, UI, requirements, architecture design itself, or test cases.
- Don't replace Leader's generic gate (multica-verification skill).
- Architecture-level disagreement goes to ArchReviewer; you own implementation-layer quality.
- Still FAIL at round 3 → mark "escalate to human", hand to Leader, stop looping.
