# AGENTS.md

This repository is a practical **Copy. Paste. Run.** library of Agent · Squad · Skill · Issue templates for [Multica](https://github.com/multica-ai/multica). Every template can be copied and used as-is. Templates are in English; this file is the agent entry point.

## Core conventions

- **Skill naming**: `multica-` prefix + lowercase hyphenated; the `name` field in `SKILL.md` matches the directory name.
- **Skills mount by name**: documents reference `multica-xxx` (in backticks), never a repo path.
- **Agent naming**: `role + project + member-id` (e.g. `BackendDev-user-service-u1024`).
- **Automation is config-driven and secret-free**: `scripts/multica-sync/` holds optional sync scripts (Python 3.9+, stdlib only). They never contain a host, token, workspace or ID — those come from env vars or the git-ignored `config.local.json`; the join key is always the *name* (agent name, skill name, squad name), so no UUID is ever committed.
- **Directory semantics**: inside each language tree, `agents/` = roles, `skills/` = practices, `squad/` = squad combinations, and `docs/` = methodology. CI hard-gate templates live in the `multica-artifact-cicd-sync` skill; artifact landing to team platforms lives in the six `multica-artifact-*` skills (see `artifact-conventions.md` — platforms are decoupled from role prompts, swappable per company); there is no standalone `gates/` directory.
- **Four-layer skill model**: **content** (`multica-pm-requirement-spec`, `multica-technical-design`, `multica-backend-impl`, `multica-frontend-impl`, `multica-test-t1-design` / `-t2-coverage` / `-t3-*`) defines what "good" means; **orchestration** (`multica-artifact-*`, `multica-test-orchestration`) lands artifacts and returns stable links; **platform** (`multica-platform-*`) is the only layer touching external systems; **review** (`multica-review-*`, plus `multica-verification` for gatekeeping) is executed by non-producers. Company-specific URLs/credentials live **only** in `multica-platform-*` shells. Public repo ships content + orchestration + platform shells; a team fills the shells' `config.yaml` / `scripts/` without touching roles. See `docs/en_US/role-skills-architecture.md`.
- **`MULTICA.md` per product repo**: automation paths differ per project, so the product repo (one copy per repo when frontend/backend are split) carries a root `MULTICA.md` declaring layout, test paths, build/verify commands, and branch conventions. Tester/FrontendDev/BackendDev read it instead of guessing; a missing file is BLOCKED. See `docs/en_US/test-automation-in-repo.md`.

## Change conventions

- **Repo-wide sync**: once a path, name, or structure diagram changes, sync README / Starter README / docs / ROADMAP, and grep the repo for stale names to confirm no residue (historical CHANGELOG entries excluded).
- **Record CHANGELOG**: every user-visible change appends an entry to `CHANGELOG.md` (version + date + Added / Changed / Removed).
- **Keep starters copy-paste-ready**: `templates/squad/software-development` is the MVP; changes must not break "copy → paste → run".
- **New templates come with explanation**: provide "why it works" and "common failure modes"; templates not yet proven on real tasks go to `ROADMAP.md` first.
- **Template style**: prefer directly copyable Markdown code blocks; agent templates state responsibilities / prohibitions / delivery format.

## Don't

- Commit secrets or sensitive information (tokens, API keys, private keys, local absolute paths, real workspace slugs / emails). Use placeholders (`YOUR_API_KEY`, `<workspace-slug>`).
- Claim there is a single "correct" number of agents — pick the smallest viable combination for the task.
- Replace the official Multica documentation — link to it instead.
- Introduce large binaries without good reason.
- Let completers approve their own work — gatekeeping is done by a non-producer (the Leader reruns `multica-verification` or relies on the CI verdict).

## How to work

1. `read_file` before editing.
2. Make minimal edits (`replace_in_file`); never rewrite whole files.
3. Confirm before destructive operations (delete, move, external publish).
4. After changes, grep for stale names/paths, run `read_lints`, and get zero errors.
